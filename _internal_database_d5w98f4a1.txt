tutorial that will hopefully clear up some things:\r1.To check if the position of Player 3's Start Location is at the location you placed it at, look at EPD 3312. \r2. Look at the X pixel placement of P3 start location in your map editor and\rwrite it down.\r3. Look at the Y pixel placement of P3 start location in your map editor\rand write it down.\r4. Now plug those numbers into this formula:\rMemory at Death Table + 3312 is exactly (3145792 + (((Start Location X * 16777216) + (Start Location Y * 256)) * 256) + (4194352 * 65536) + (805322752 * 16777216))\r3145792, 4194352, and 805322752 are \"constants,\" that you need to know and account for in the equation. Because EPD reads 4 bytes at once (this formula does not work for Player 1 and Player 2 Start Location. If you understood everything that was said so far, then coming up with another formula that's specific to those two will be easy).\r5. The trigger should work, and if it doesn't, then either you have miscalculated or these \"unknowns\", are not constant.\rChallenge - Find out what those unknowns are actually for, and\/or create an easier formula than the one I have come up with.","playerID":"3311 (Byte Offset: 00)"},{"platform":{"name":"Win","id":0},"version":{"name":"1.16.1","id":10},"address":"0058D718","link":"?pg=entry&addr=0x0058D718&ver=1.16.1&plat=win","size":"1","name":"#'s of Game Pauses","length":"8","description":"EPD 3309: \rThe base value of this address is: (P1 + P2 + P3 + P4) * 3 = 50529027\rPlayer 1: *1 \rPlayer 2: *256 \rPlayer 3: *65536 \rPlayer 4: *16777216 \rPlayer 1, 2, 3, and 4 all have three remaining game pauses that they can use to stop the game from running temporarily.
